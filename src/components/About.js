            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            As an accomplished blockchain developer with a solid foundation from Columbia University's Engineering FinTech Boot Camp, 
            I bring a unique blend of technical proficiency and creative insight to the world of financial technology. 
            Graduating with a 4.0 GPA, my academic journey was deeply rooted in mastering the art of 
            creating, coding, and executing sophisticated trading algorithms, bots, and pioneering blockchain technologies. 
            My expertise spans across NFTs, cryptocurrency, EVM compatible smart contracts, and beyond, 
            enabling me to deliver innovative solutions in the fast-evolving Web3 landscape.
            </p>

            <p>
            Before venturing into the realm of Web3, I established myself as an award-winning filmmaker and content producer, 
            known for my exceptional storytelling skills and a knack for bringing original ideas to life. 
            My background in the film industry has equipped me with a profound understanding of visual storytelling, 
            allowing me to approach blockchain development with an artistic lens. 
            This unique perspective enhances my ability to develop and visually represent new concepts, 
            ensuring they are not only technologically advanced but also engaging and accessible.
            My journey from an award-winning filmmaker to a blockchain developer underscores my ability to 
            adapt, learn, and thrive in diverse environments, making me a valuable asset to any project 
            at the forefront of financial innovation.
